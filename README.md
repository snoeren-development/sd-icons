# SD Icons
Embed font icons onto your Joomla-powered websites! This plugin provides tags that will be replaced anywhere on your website. Embedding fonts is as easy as `{far fa-fw fa-user m-2}` which becomes `<i class="far fa-fw fa-user m-2"></i>`. You can use the tags everywhere, including but not limited to:
- Menu items
- Content
- Modules
- Products
- Image Galleries
- And more!

## Installing
[Download this repository](https://github.com/snoeren-development/sd-icons/archive/master.zip) and install the plugin using the installer in the administrator side of your Joomla website. Then, enable and configure the plugin using the plugin manager.
